# Hoos Open

**Hoos Open** is a student-built mobile app that helps UVA students quickly discover the open/closed status, location, and hours of operation of buildings across the university. Whether it's a library, gym, dining hall, or cafe, Hoos Open makes it easy to find where to go and when ‚Äî all at your fingertips.

This project was built as part of academic coursework for **CS 4720: Mobile Application Development** at the University of Virginia.

## Purpose

The purpose of **Hoos Open** is to provide UVA students with an intuitive interface to:

- Check real-time open/closed status for campus buildings
- View detailed hours of operation
- Explore facilities by category (Dining, Gym, Academic, etc.)
- Favorite commonly used buildings
- Navigate to detailed information for each location

The app pulls data from a Firebase database that includes real-world building hours, including special formatting (e.g., `"M-F"` or `"Varies: Check schedule"`) and intelligently parses and displays the correct open/closed status in real-time.
